-- `t.created` holds the full timestamp (date and time), offering a precise moment of transaction creation. 
-- `t.partition_date`, however, stores only the date (YYYY-MM-DD), and is partitioned to enhance query performance by splitting the data into manageable chunks, 
-- reducing the time required for data retrieval, especially for large datasets.
